# DevOps Manager Survey - Conversational Questions
## For Kubecon In-Person Conversations

### Context
These 3 questions are designed for quick 2-3 minute conversations with DevOps/Platform/Infrastructure managers at Kubecon. Focus on team and operational challenges rather than technical details. If they show interest, offer the QR code to the extended survey.

## The 3 Questions

### 1. Discovery - Operational Pain Points
**"What operational challenges does your team face managing YAML across your infrastructure?"**

*Listen for:*
- Team productivity issues
- Configuration sprawl and consistency
- Security and compliance concerns
- Incident response related to YAML
- Lack of expertise or training needs
- Tool gaps for validation/management
- Cross-team coordination issues
- Technical debt accumulation

*Follow-up probes if needed:*
- "How does this impact your team's velocity or reliability?"
- "Have YAML issues caused incidents or delayed releases?"

### 2. Resource and Risk Assessment
**"How much of your team's time goes toward YAML-related issues - troubleshooting, training, staying current with security updates, etc.?"**

*Listen for:*
- Time spent firefighting vs building
- Knowledge concentrated in few people
- Onboarding challenges for new team members
- Reactive vs proactive approach
- Budget implications of internal expertise
- Risk concerns about dependency on maintainers
- Opportunity cost of focusing on YAML vs business value

*This reveals the business case for external support*

### 3. Decision-Making Interest
**"If you could get professional support and maintenance for YAML infrastructure - including security guarantees and expert access - from the original creator, would that help your team?"**

*Listen for:*
- "Absolutely, where do I sign up?" = hot lead
- "Yes, especially for [specific benefit]" = warm, need-focused
- "Interesting, what would that look like?" = qualified interest
- "Maybe, but budget is tight" = interested but need ROI case
- "We're handling it fine internally" = probably not ready

*For interested responses:*
"I'd love to understand your team's specific needs better. I have a survey that takes about 5-7 minutes and asks about your operational challenges and what would be most valuable. Would you scan this QR code?"

## Conversation Tips

### Opening Line
"Hi, I'm [name] - I work with Ingy döt Net, who co-created YAML. We're talking to infrastructure and DevOps leaders about how they manage YAML at scale. Do you have a couple of minutes to share your perspective?"

### Building Credibility
- Position as someone who understands operational challenges, not just tech
- Reference managing libyaml, pyyaml, go-yaml across thousands of users
- Emphasize you're here to learn from practitioners

### Adapting to Manager Perspective
- Focus on team impact, not just technical issues
- Use business language: risk, efficiency, velocity, cost
- Ask about decision-making process if they seem interested

### Reading Interest Level
- **High Interest:** Shares specific challenges, asks questions about solutions, mentions budget process
- **Medium Interest:** Acknowledges problems, interested but cautious
- **Low Interest:** "We're fine," dismissive, hurried

Only offer QR code to high and medium interest conversations.

### Closing
**If they scan QR code:**
"Perfect! The survey asks about your team's needs and decision process. I'll follow up based on your responses."

**If they decline QR code but seemed interested:**
"No problem! Here's my card - feel free to reach out. We're still in early stages and would love your input later."

**If not interested:**
"Thanks for your time! Enjoy Kubecon."
