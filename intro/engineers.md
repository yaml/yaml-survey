## For Kubecon In-Person Conversations

### Context
These 3 questions are designed for quick 2-3 minute conversations at Kubecon. Keep it conversational and natural. If they show interest, offer the QR code to the extended survey.

## The 3 Questions

### 1. Discovery - Pain Points
**"What's your biggest headache when working with YAML in your infrastructure?"**

*Listen for:*
- Security concerns (CVEs, vulnerabilities)
- Parsing issues or compatibility problems
- Configuration errors at scale
- Lack of tooling or validation
- Performance issues
- Learning curve for team members
- Debugging difficulties

*Follow-up probes if needed:*
- "Have you experienced any YAML-related incidents or outages?"
- "How much time does your team spend troubleshooting YAML issues?"

---

### 2. Current State - Gap Identification
**"How does your team currently handle YAML issues when they come up?"**

*Listen for:*
- Internal expertise (do they have it?)
- Google/Stack Overflow dependency
- Trial and error approaches
- Lack of official resources
- Waiting for library maintainers
- Building internal tools
- Just living with problems

*This reveals the gap that YES could fill*

### 3. Interest Qualifier
**"If there was professional support and maintenance for YAML infrastructure directly from the co-creator, would that be valuable to your organization?"**

*Listen for:*
- Immediate "yes" = hot lead
- "Maybe, tell me more" = warm lead
- "We'd need to see details" = qualified interest
- "Not really" or concerns about cost = probably not ready

*For interested responses:*
"Great! I'd love to get your detailed feedback. I have a short survey that takes about 5 minutes - would you mind scanning this QR code? Your input will directly shape what we build."

## Conversation Tips

### Opening Line
"Hi, I'm [name] - I co-created YAML with Ingy döt Net. We're here gathering feedback from engineers about YAML pain points. Do you have 2 minutes to answer a few quick questions?"

### Building Credibility
- Mention you co-created YAML if they don't know
- Reference that you maintain libyaml, pyyaml, go-yaml
- Keep it humble and focused on listening

### Reading Interest Level
- **High Interest:** Extended eye contact, asking follow-up questions, mentioning specific problems
- **Medium Interest:** Polite but reserved, brief answers
- **Low Interest:** Checking phone, looking around, very short responses

Only offer QR code to high and medium interest conversations.

### Closing
**If they scan QR code:**
"Thanks so much! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions - my contact info is at the end of the survey."

**If they decline QR code but seemed interested:**
"No problem! Here's my card if you'd like to continue the conversation later."

**If not interested:**
"Thanks for your time! Enjoy the conference."
