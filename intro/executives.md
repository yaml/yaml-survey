# Executive Survey - Conversational Questions
## For Kubecon In-Person Conversations

### Context
These 3 questions are designed for brief 2-3 minute conversations with C-level executives (CTO, CIO, CISO, VP Engineering) at Kubecon. Keep it strategic and business-focused. If they show interest, offer the QR code for their team to complete, or take their card for follow-up.

## The 3 Questions

### 1. Discovery - Strategic Risk Assessment
**"From a strategic perspective, how do you think about the risk of critical open source dependencies like YAML in your infrastructure?"**

*Listen for:*
- Supply chain security concerns
- Post-Log4j/XZ awareness
- Board or audit committee pressure
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Business continuity planning
- Insurance and liability considerations
- "Too important to fail" mentality
- Vendor risk management frameworks

*Follow-up probes if needed:*
- "Has this come up in board meetings or security reviews?"
- "How do you currently mitigate OSS infrastructure risk?"

---

### 2. Business Impact - Cost of Uncertainty
**"If a critical YAML vulnerability was discovered tomorrow, what would the business impact be to your organization?"**

*Listen for:*
- Immediate revenue impact
- Customer trust and brand concerns
- Compliance violations or penalties
- Emergency response costs
- Opportunity cost of engineering time
- Market/competitive disadvantage
- "We can't afford downtime" statements
- Quantified risk assessments

*This reveals their mental calculation of insurance value*

### 3. Investment Framework
**"Would having a professional support relationship with the team that created and maintains YAML infrastructure make sense as part of your OSS risk management strategy?"**

*Listen for:*
- "Absolutely, this is exactly what we need" = hot lead
- "Yes, if the ROI is clear" = financially-focused, need business case
- "Interesting - tell me more" = curious, needs education
- "We'd need to evaluate" = process-oriented, longer sales cycle
- "How much?" = budget-conscious but interested
- "Not a priority right now" = probably not ready

*For interested responses:*
"I'd love to share more details and understand your organization's specific needs. I have a brief survey - it would be valuable if someone from your team could fill it out, or I can follow up directly with you."

## Conversation Tips

### Opening Line - Executive Context
"Hi, I'm [name] - I work with Ingy döt Net, the co-creator of YAML. We're talking with technology leaders about how they think about risk management for critical open source infrastructure. Do you have a moment?"

**Alternative opener if you know their company:**
"Hi [name], I'm with YAML LLC - we noticed [Company] has significant Kubernetes infrastructure. We're exploring enterprise support models for critical OSS dependencies and would love your perspective."

### Building Credibility
- Lead with business value and risk, not technology
- Reference post-Log4j/XZ awareness: "enterprises are rethinking OSS risk"
- Position as strategic partner, not vendor
- Mention other Fortune 500 companies exploring this (when true)

### Executive Communication Style
- **Be concise:** They have limited time
- **Lead with business impact:** Risk, cost, efficiency
- **Speak their language:** ROI, insurance, strategic positioning
- **Respect their time:** Offer to follow up vs expecting detailed conversation
- **Know when to pivot:** If they're interested but busy, get intro to their team

### Reading Interest Level
- **High Interest:** Asks detailed questions, shares specific concerns, mentions budget/timeline
- **Strategic Interest:** Wants to delegate to team but is sponsoring
- **Medium Interest:** Acknowledges problem, wants more information
- **Low Interest:** Polite but disengaged, "send me something"

### Delegation Recognition
Executives often won't fill out surveys themselves but may:
- Introduce you to their VP Engineering or DevOps leader
- Ask you to email their team
- Take your card for internal discussion

This is still a win! Capture the referral carefully.

### Closing

**If they're highly interested:**
"Great! Would it make sense to set up a brief call next week, or should I connect with someone on your team?"

**If they want to delegate:**
"Perfect - who on your team should I connect with? I'll send them the survey and can discuss your specific needs."

**If they'll scan QR code (rare for executives):**
"Excellent - this brief survey will help us understand your priorities. I'll follow up based on your responses."

**If they want to think about it:**
"Absolutely - here's my card. Feel free to reach out when you're ready, or I can send you a one-pager summarizing the value proposition."

**If not interested:**
"I appreciate your time! Enjoy Kubecon."

## Executive-Specific Best Practices

### Time Management
- **Target time:** 2 minutes or less for all 3 questions
- Be ready to abbreviate if they're rushed
- Offer to continue via email/call if conversation is flowing

### Name Dropping (When Appropriate)
- "We're talking to several Fortune 500 companies about this"
- "Post-Log4j, we've seen board-level interest in OSS sustainability"
- Only if true and not confidential

### Business Case Framing
Frame the value in terms they care about:
- **Risk Mitigation:** "Insurance against critical infrastructure failures"
- **Efficiency:** "Free up your team to build vs maintain dependencies"
- **Compliance:** "Meet audit requirements for OSS supply chain"
- **Strategic:** "Influence the roadmap of infrastructure that powers your business"

### Red Flags to Notice
- "Send me an email" (often means not interested but being polite)
- "We're cutting budgets" (timing may be wrong)
- "Our team handles this" (may not see the value)
- Immediate price focus without value discussion (price shopping, not buying)

### Green Flags to Notice
- Specific incident or near-miss stories
- Mentions board/audit pressure
- Asks about other customers or case studies
- Discusses budget or procurement process
- Introduces you to technical team immediately
- Takes detailed notes or asks detailed questions
